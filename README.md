### Code Linting

Code linting is done before committing your code through [_pre-commit_](https://pre-commit.com), configured with `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. In order to enable the pre-commit linting hooks, you will need to install `pre-commit` in your environment and install the hooks.

Install `pre-commit` (using `conda` as an example):

```bash
conda install pre-commit
```

Check if `pre-commit` is installed properly:

```bash
pre-commit --version
```

Install hooks as specified in the config file:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
